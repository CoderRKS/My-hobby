        <p class="text_about">My favorite hobby is <b>Cubing</b>. In this, we learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube, which
            comes in
            diffrent varites. The most common of them is 3x3 Rubik's Cube. I started cubing in 2018 and learnd to solve
            almost 10 types of Rubik's Cube. This is a type of skill in which we requires pations and concertation to
            achive
            it.I have spent almost 3 to 4 years to learn all the 10 types of it.So at last I would like to say that
            don't
            give up and don't stop until you achive it ..... <br>
